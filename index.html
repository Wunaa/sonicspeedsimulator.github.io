            <article>
                <h3>Attacks on Modding and YouTube Videos</h3>
                <p>Nintendo's aggressive stance against modding and YouTube videos featuring game mods has had severe repercussions for content creators. DMCA takedowns result in strikes against channels, impacting visibility and revenue. This harsh approach damages creators' ability to share their passion and reach their audience effectively.</p>

                <h3>Removal of Game OSTs</h3>
                <p>The iconic music from Nintendo's games is a major part of their appeal, yet the company has aggressively removed fan-uploaded OSTs. With few official releases available, this practice leaves fans without legal access to the music they love, while creators face harsh penalties for sharing it.</p>

                <h3>Fangame Takedowns</h3>
                <p>Fangames are created out of love for Nintendo's franchises, often at no cost to the company. Despite this, Nintendo has targeted these projects with DMCA takedowns, preventing fans from enjoying new experiences and stifling creative expression within the community.</p>

                <h3>Suppression of Fan-Made Content</h3>
                <p>Nintendo's approach extends to fan art, animations, and other creative works. This zero-tolerance policy disregards the positive contributions of the community and discourages fan engagement. The companyâ€™s actions send a message that fan creativity is not valued.</p>

            <h2>Why Boycott?</h2>
            <p>The boycott is a response to Nintendo's consistent pattern of behavior that undermines the contributions of its fanbase. By withholding support, we signal our demand for a more respectful and supportive approach. This boycott is not an attack but a call for meaningful change to address the mistreatment of creators and fans.</p>
            <p>Our aim is to encourage Nintendo to reassess its policies and recognize the value of the community's contributions. We hope that by uniting our voices, we can foster a more positive and inclusive environment within the gaming industry.</p>
