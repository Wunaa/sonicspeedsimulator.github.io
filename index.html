            <h2>Why Boycott Nintendo?</h2>
            <p>Nintendo has been a beloved name in gaming for decades, but recent actions have shown a troubling pattern of disregarding its fanbase. This site aims to highlight these issues and rally support for a boycott until Nintendo addresses these concerns. Our mission is to advocate for fair treatment of content creators, developers, and fans who contribute to the gaming community.</p>

            <h2>Issues with Nintendo</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Attacks on Modding and YouTube Videos</h3>
                <p>Nintendo’s aggressive stance against modding and YouTube videos featuring game mods has profoundly impacted the content creation community. The company’s frequent issuance of DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) takedown notices has led to numerous videos being removed from the platform. These takedowns not only disrupt the availability of content but also result in strikes against the channels responsible. For many content creators, receiving a DMCA strike can have serious consequences, including reduced visibility, limited access to monetization features, and potential suspension or termination of their channels.

This harsh approach by Nintendo creates significant barriers for creators who are passionate about sharing their unique modifications, gameplay experiences, and creative interpretations of Nintendo’s beloved games. The constant threat of takedowns undermines their ability to connect with their audience and showcase their work. As a result, creators may struggle to maintain their presence on YouTube and other platforms, severely affecting their ability to generate revenue and build a loyal fanbase.

Moreover, this restrictive policy stifles the creative freedom of the gaming community, as modders and video creators are often key to expanding and enhancing the gaming experience. By limiting the sharing of game mods and related content, Nintendo’s approach not only affects individual creators but also diminishes the diversity and richness of the gaming content available to fans. This creates an environment where creative expression and fan engagement are curtailed, ultimately impacting the broader gaming community’s ability to explore and celebrate the games they love.</p>

                <h3>Removal of Game OSTs</h3>
                <p>The iconic music from Nintendo’s games is a cornerstone of their appeal, often playing a significant role in shaping the overall gaming experience and nostalgia for many fans. However, Nintendo's stringent approach to protecting its intellectual property has led to the aggressive removal of fan-uploaded Original Soundtracks (OSTs) from various platforms. This policy is particularly problematic given the limited availability of official soundtrack releases from the company.<p>
                <p>With only a few official OST releases available for purchase or streaming, fans are frequently left without legal access to the music they hold dear. This scarcity creates a gap between the demand for Nintendo’s memorable game music and the availability of legitimate channels to enjoy it. As a result, many fans turn to fan-uploaded content to relive their favorite tunes, only to find that these uploads are often taken down by Nintendo due to copyright infringement claims.<p>

                <p>For creators who share these beloved soundtracks, the repercussions can be severe. They face harsh penalties such as DMCA takedowns, strikes against their channels, and potential legal action. These consequences not only impact their ability to share content but also jeopardize their presence on platforms like YouTube, where they may struggle to maintain visibility and revenue. This restrictive policy diminishes opportunities for fans to access and enjoy the music that enhances their gaming experience, while creators are penalized for their efforts to celebrate and preserve Nintendo’s rich musical legacy.<p>

                <p>The lack of official releases and the aggressive stance on fan-uploaded content collectively hinder the enjoyment and preservation of Nintendo’s game music. It creates a frustrating situation where fans and creators are both left without satisfactory solutions, impacting the broader community’s ability to celebrate and engage with the music that forms an integral part of Nintendo’s gaming heritage.</p>

                <h3>Fangame Takedowns</h3>
                <p>Fangames are created out of love for Nintendo's franchises, often at no cost to the company. Despite this, Nintendo has targeted these projects with DMCA takedowns, preventing fans from enjoying new experiences and stifling creative expression within the community.</p>

                <h3>Suppression of Fan-Made Content</h3>
                <p>Nintendo's approach extends to fan art, animations, and other creative works. This zero-tolerance policy disregards the positive contributions of the community and discourages fan engagement. The company’s actions send a message that fan creativity is not valued.</p>

            <h2>Why Boycott?</h2>
            <p>The boycott is a response to Nintendo's consistent pattern of behavior that undermines the contributions of its fanbase. By withholding support, we signal our demand for a more respectful and supportive approach. This boycott is not an attack but a call for meaningful change to address the mistreatment of creators and fans.</p>
            <p>Our aim is to encourage Nintendo to reassess its policies and recognize the value of the community's contributions. We hope that by uniting our voices, we can foster a more positive and inclusive environment within the gaming industry.</p>
