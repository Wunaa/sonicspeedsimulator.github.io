            <h2>Why Boycott Nintendo?</h2>
            <p>Nintendo has long been a cornerstone of the gaming industry, known for its beloved franchises and innovative gameplay. However, recent actions by the company have revealed a pattern of aggressive and unjust behavior towards its fanbase. This website is dedicated to raising awareness about these issues and advocating for a boycott until Nintendo makes meaningful changes. Our goal is to show that we, as a community, will not tolerate the mistreatment of content creators, developers, and fans.</p>

            <h2>Issues with Nintendo</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Modding and YouTube Videos</h3>
                <p>Modding has been an essential part of gaming culture, allowing players to enhance their experiences and showcase their creativity. However, Nintendo has taken a hardline stance against modding, issuing full DMCA takedowns against YouTube videos that showcase these modifications. These actions are not just simple copyright claims; they are legal threats that can severely damage a creator's channel. The consequences include the potential for channel strikes, reduced visibility, and a loss of income, making it harder for creators to continue their work.</p>

                <h3>Game OST Takedowns</h3>
                <p>Nintendo's games are renowned for their iconic music, which plays a significant role in the gaming experience. Despite the love for these soundtracks, Nintendo has aggressively removed videos and channels sharing game OSTs through DMCA takedowns. This is particularly concerning given that Nintendo rarely releases official soundtracks for public purchase or streaming. As a result, fans are left without legal means to enjoy the music, while creators who share these soundtracks face severe consequences. The removal of these videos not only diminishes the cultural impact of the music but also disregards the contributions of composers and fans.</p>

                <h3>Fangame Takedowns</h3>
                <p>Fangames are often a labor of love, created by fans who wish to expand on the stories and worlds they cherish. These projects are typically free and non-commercial, offering new experiences that complement the original games. Nevertheless, Nintendo has consistently targeted fangames with DMCA takedowns, forcing developers to cease all activity. This legal action not only nullifies the developers' hard work but also sends a chilling message to the fan community: creativity and passion are unwelcome. By stifling these projects, Nintendo limits the scope of innovation and prevents fans from celebrating their favorite franchises in new and exciting ways.</p>

                <h3>Other Fan-Made Content</h3>
                <p>The crackdown on fan-made content extends beyond modding and fangames. Nintendo has issued DMCA takedowns against a wide array of fan-created works, including artwork, animations, and even merchandise. These items are often made out of admiration for the company's characters and stories, with no intent to harm or profit at Nintendo's expense. Yet, the company has taken a zero-tolerance approach, disregarding the positive impact these works have on the community. This policy not only alienates fans but also stifles the creative expression that has always been a hallmark of the gaming culture.</p>

        <section id="boycott">
            <h2>Why Boycott?</h2>
            <p>We believe that the only way to effectively communicate our dissatisfaction with Nintendo's practices is through a boycott. By withholding our financial support, we send a clear message: we demand better treatment and respect. This boycott is not about attacking Nintendo but advocating for change. We want a future where Nintendo values its community, respects creators' rights, and fosters an environment that encourages innovation and passion.</p>
            <p>The decision to boycott is not made lightly. It is a response to a consistent pattern of behavior that disregards the community's contributions. Our aim is to show that the fanbase will not accept the mistreatment of its members. We hope that this collective action will lead to a reevaluation of Nintendo's policies and a commitment to a more positive and supportive approach.</p>
