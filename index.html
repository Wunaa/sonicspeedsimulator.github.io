            <h2>Why Boycott Nintendo?</h2>
            <p>Nintendo has long been a beloved company, known for its iconic games and characters. However, recent actions have shown a troubling pattern of disregard for the community that has supported them. This website aims to shed light on these issues and advocate for a boycott until meaningful change is made. Our goal is to stand up for the rights of content creators, fans, and developers who have been unfairly targeted by Nintendo's aggressive policies.</p>

            <h2>Issues with Nintendo</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Modding and YouTube Videos</h3>
                <p>Nintendo has a notorious history of targeting modding videos on platforms like YouTube. These videos, often made by dedicated fans, showcase modifications that enhance gameplay, fix issues, or add new content. Despite the positive contributions these mods make, Nintendo has consistently taken them down, citing copyright infringement. This not only stifles creativity but also harms the channels of content creators. A single takedown can severely affect a channel's analytics, making it less visible to new viewers and stunting its growth.</p>

                <h3>Game OST Takedowns</h3>
                <p>Music is an integral part of any gaming experience, and Nintendo's games are no exception. However, the company has been relentless in taking down videos and channels that upload game soundtracks (OSTs). This is particularly frustrating for fans, as Nintendo rarely provides official avenues to listen to their iconic music. The removal of these videos is a disservice to both the fans who wish to relive their favorite moments and the composers whose work goes underappreciated.</p>

                <h3>Fangame Takedowns</h3>
                <p>Fangames have been a staple of the gaming community, showcasing the talent and passion of fans who want to explore new stories, characters, and gameplay mechanics. These projects are typically free and do not compete with official products. Despite this, Nintendo has aggressively targeted fangames, issuing cease-and-desist letters that force developers to shut down their projects. This has led to the loss of countless hours of hard work and creativity, discouraging future fan projects.</p>

                <h3>Other Fan-Made Content</h3>
                <p>Nintendo's crackdown extends beyond modding and fangames. The company has targeted a wide range of fan-made content, including art, animations, and merchandise. Many of these projects are non-commercial and made purely out of love for the franchise. By taking these down, Nintendo sends a message that they do not value their community's creativity and passion. This attitude not only alienates fans but also stifles the cultural impact of their games.</p>

            <h2>Why Boycott?</h2>
            <p>We believe that by financially supporting Nintendo through purchasing their games and products, we are indirectly endorsing their actions against fans and creators. A boycott is a powerful tool of protest. It sends a clear message that we, as a community, demand better treatment and respect. Our goal is not to hurt Nintendo financially, but to advocate for a change in policy. We hope to see a future where Nintendo embraces its community, supports creativity, and respects the rights of its fans.</p>
            <p>Boycotting Nintendo products and services may seem like a small gesture, but when done collectively, it can have a significant impact. It is a demonstration of our commitment to holding the company accountable for its actions. We encourage everyone to join this boycott as a form of peaceful protest and to advocate for a more inclusive and respectful approach towards fan-made content.</p>

Supporting these creators not only helps them grow but also sends a message that respect for the community is valuable. Explore indie games, follow developers who encourage modding, and participate in communities that celebrate creativity.</p>

                <h3>Promote Fair Use and Open Content</h3>
                <p>One of the core issues in this situation is the debate over fair use and open content. Supporting movements and initiatives that advocate for fair use rights and the protection of fan-made content is essential. These movements work towards ensuring that fans and creators can share their work without fear of legal repercussions. Stay informed about relevant legislation and support organizations that fight for these rights.</p>
